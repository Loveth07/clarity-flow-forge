# FlowForge
A decentralized workflow automation tool built on the Stacks blockchain. FlowForge allows users to create, manage and execute automated workflows in a transparent and immutable way.

## Getting Started
Clone the repository and install dependencies:
```clarinet install```

Run tests:
```clarinet test```

## Using Workflow Templates
Workflow templates allow you to define reusable workflow patterns that can be instantiated multiple times. This is useful for standardizing processes across your organization.

To create a template:
1. Define the initial state and allowed transitions
2. Specify approvers for each state
3. Create workflows from the template

Templates ensure consistency and reduce setup time for common workflow patterns.
